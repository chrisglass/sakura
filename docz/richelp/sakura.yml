sakura:
 Synopsys: This is about my Sakura project, which is a Git repo freely available on github to
  help people like you waste their time on funny scripts :) You can also create your own YAML
  files if you put it in $SAKURADIR/doc/richelp/. For instance you could add your friends you
  invited to a party and keep track of invitations, presences and absences and make stats over
  them then.
samples:
  'ls | act': 'randomly scrambles the lines! Taken from cat/cat ;)'
  'ps | rainbow': 'colors all lines differently'
  'twice itunes -': lowers volume of iTunes... twice :)
  '10 echo Bart Simpson likes it DRY': tells you this 10 times. Very sarcastic script!
  'seq 100 | 1suN 7': prints every 7th element of the list
  zombies: 'prints processes that show zombies (plus funny options to kill them)'
  'find . -size +300M | xargs mvto /tmp/bigfiles/': moves big files to that directory
  "alias gp='never_as_root git pull'": only if u r not root it runs!
  dimmiora: Tells you the time with Riccardo voice in Italian. Brilliant!
  'echo $PATH | split':                             Splits path on ':'. Amazing innit?
  richelp sakura: help to this one
  richelp ubuntu: help on how to use Ubuntu
  duplicates: finds file in the current subtree which are identical
